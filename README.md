# IoT-Enabled Cold Chain Management using Blockchain

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on monitoring and securing pharmaceutical cold chain data using **IoT sensors**, a **Node.js + Express backend**, and **blockchain technology**. It ensures that temperature and location data collected during transportation is recorded in a **tamper-proof and decentralized** manner using **Hyperledger Fabric**.

The system improves **traceability, transparency, and compliance** in pharmaceutical cold chain logistics without relying on centralized cloud storage.
